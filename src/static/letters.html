    <p>I recently re-discovered email for myself as a long-form communication medium. Nowadays, I'll take the chance to initiate an email conversation whenever I can. It's nice to give yourself and others a reason to write, especially if the writing is non-academic, freeform and is bound to be read by at least one person. </p>
    <p>I was recently talking to a friend who said they started writing a "newsletter" about their life happenings over the course of the last year around winter holidays and bcc'ing close friends, which can be a nice conversation starter.</p>
    <h2>From Conversations - by me</h2>

    <summary><h3>Ursula Le Guin - Earthsea</h3></summary>
    <details>
    I find that I share this quote with the surrounding thought quite a lot

        <p>I recently went back and read Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea cycle;
        What I find interesting is that she didn't write all 5 books in one sitting - and that maturity distance really shows.
            The first 3 books are really adventure-focused, very classically male-hero (even if imbued with elegant and heartfelt wisdom) driven; all written in the span of 4 years - 1968 ro 1972. Then there's a 4th book fully focused on a heroine who was a magical being in book 2 but pursued a "simple life" and is now more or less going through a midlife crisis and questioning her place in society and her past. Not much novel time has passed, but this no longer feels like a young adult adventure novel; published in 1990 - 18 years after the 3rd book, those who grew up with the first 3 books now would be ready to face quite different questions.</p>

        <p>Still haven't made my way into the last few books, but figured I'd share; there's a strange sense of loss for myself as a young teen who didn't get to experience it then. I am glad I got to it now and excited for how much more there is in the world for me.</p>

        <p>Finally, here's a quick quote I really love from the book
        (for quick context: Ged is the protagonist, in his early teens and is apprentice to a somewhat reclusive wizard named Ogion. I think here they are out walking in the mountains. Ogion is also very quiet and Ged gets impatient feeling like he is not learning anything from his master). </p>

    <blockquote>
        Mastery is nine times patience. What is that herb by the path?'
        'Strawflower.'
        'And that?'
        'I don't know.'
        'Fourfoil, they call it.' Ogion had halted, the coppershod foot of his staff near the little weed, so Ged looked closely at the plant, and plucked a dry seedpod from it, and finally asked, since Ogion said nothing more, 'What is its use, Master?'
        'None I know of.'
        Ged kept the seedpod a while as they went on, then tossed it away.
        'When you know the fourfoil in all its seasons root and leaf and flower, by sight and scent and seed, then you may learn its true name, knowing its being: which is more than its use. What, after all, is the use of you? or of myself? Is Gont Mountain useful, or the Open Sea?' Ogion went on a half mile or so, and said at last, 'To hear, one must be silent.‚Äù
    </blockquote>

    <p>For one, it does have a very fairytale-like quality to it. But I love the three points being made there:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> to know a name of a plant, animal or being means nothing in itself. So easily curiosity can be dispelled with learning of a name for a word, phenomenon, being. But name is only the beginning of knowing something. The thought keeps me coming back</li>
            <li>the lightness with which a human being is compared with that of a plant somehow makes life feel lighter. Afterall, there is no use, is there? Simple answer - "none that I know of". Not that there isn't a use, just the humility to admit of not knowing one</li>
        <li>and, finally, there's the "to hear, one must be silent". Like anything true, the phrase rings out into space and finds its way somewhere close, right behind the top of my forehead. I think of the moment when you are walking through a forest and the only thing you seem to hear is yourself panting and stepping on the ground. Then for a moment - stop. Not always to admire the view of the mountains; sometimes, just to look around - close your eyes and feel what the world is with you right in the middle of it.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Early email days</h3>
    <p>My friends and I had written lengthy emails to each other, about our weddings, what we were doing, the early days of parenthood.  It was like finding a treasure trove of letters.  And some of these were with friends that I lived in the same city with, and saw regularly. Maybe they were just a product of having desk jobs? The transactionality of text wasn't dominant then?  I can't fully explain it, but nonetheless, I miss those nutrient-dense emails</p>
