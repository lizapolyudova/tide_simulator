# Project Notes

## 06-03-2023

Starting today, found a [base project](https://mattloftus.github.io/2016/02/03/threejs-p2/) which helped me get setup with a simple model.

## Project Goals

Long-term idea would be to:
### 1. simple simulation 

* simple earth, moon, sun simulation
* bodies are correctly rotating, (all parameters are visible and can be adjusted?)
* gravity is correctly simulated

### 1.5 mathy part

* body of water representing the ocean is correctly squished by the gravitational forces

### 2. enhanced simulation

* point-picker for coastal location, forecast tide there

### 3. sci-fi/speculative mode

* allow user specify # of moons and their locations
* pick a point on earth to forecast tides for the point
