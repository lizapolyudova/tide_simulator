    <h2>March 2023</h2>
    I'm starting this blog. Feels like another distraction from projects I already have, but it also a nice to start on
    an archive which I can share with others.

    I've been thinking a lot about audio. I recently took an audio class with <a href="">SALT</a>. Learned a lot about
    story-telling, but also mainly got exposed to pretty interesting sound art/pieces. Here are some of my favorites

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001c6gn">BBC Short Cuts - New Tense</a>
            <br>This is the first time I
            am exposed to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mk3f8">BBC Short Cuts</a> show. I continue to
            explore it going forward, lots of great stories. For the piece itself - the layering, the sculpting of the sound is amazing. With this piece we for the first time talk about the concept of "scenes" - sound environments which represent physical or mental spaces.

        <br>The story here is truly nuts. There are multiple dramatic pauses and music motifs which help to intensify the emotional impact. Specifically, segments to re-listen to are: 4:55-8:10, 11:55
            </li>

            <br>Has a very rhythmic approach, reminiscent of a beating heart. Usage of the present tense really allows the narrator to tap into the anxiety and describe bodily sensation in way which past tense generally fails to capture, since it has a more summary feel to it. Present tense seems like an alluring opportunity to tell an emotional story with more color.
