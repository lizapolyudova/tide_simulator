            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                Newgrange is a megalithic mound, a man-constructed "hill" made of layers of stone and dirt with a single
                passage aligned with the direction of the sunrise on the day of the winter solstice. The structure
                predates
                Stonehenge by approximately 2 thousand years and is located about 1 hour north of Dublin.

                As a friend of mine put it "Xianny quote about society structured". Indeed, one can learn much about the
                prehistoric society; there are countless books, there's a categorization: Stone Age, Bronze Age, etc.
                Then
                each is further subdivided into eras with sufficiently distinct characteristics. Neolithic Age - the
                last
                part of Stone Age specifically differs from the one before it [Mesolithic] by introduction of
                agriculture,
                domestication of animals and a change from nomadic lifestyle to one that is settlement-base. All those
                should not come as a surprise - whether the knowledge is sources from middle school history books or
                games
                like civilization where skills are neatly laid out as a sequence to cross the Bronze Age threshold.

            <p>
                Yet, the question stands: we don't truly understand that society.

        <h2>My visit</h2>
        <p>
            I went to Newgrange on the day of the April New Moon in 2023. Took a bus in to Drogheda from Dublin the
            night before
            and stayed in a hostel. Was lucky to catch a wonderful couple spending their last evening of working at the
            hostel,
            moving on to continue traveling to County limerick near the Burren and Ailwee caves. </p>

        <p>
            First thing on the next day I grabbed a taxi to the Newgrange visitor center, the appointment slot was at
            9:30.
            You cannot come visit the sites directly; rather, you start in the visitor center which has a museum
            explaining
            excavation and restoration history of the site; after which, a shuttle takes you to the site itself.</p>

        Newgrange is place that affected me deeply when I went to see it. There are so many themes packed in here: <br>
        * changing from nomadic people to agriculture-focused society <br>
        * tracking time with extreme precision without mathematics or a representative of reality astronomical model
        (really
        circling the word "wrong" here).<br>

        I would really like to start exploring these themes in an essay, bullet points, or any other form, really. So
        far,
        I've mostly spent my time exploring this conversation through casual conversation with people who care to listen
        and
        engage.

        <p>I am thinking about newgrange again. The room I am staying in is an attic apartment. Bed next to a diagonal
            roof window facing almost directly east. I wake up around 5 each day from the sun (going back promptly to
            sleep of course). Until 10 or so the sun framed by the window travels across the room. I only have a few
            more days, but I think I'll track how it progresses through the room, since I have my own personal.

        <p>Maybe building of the temple was partly a testament to end of the nomadic lifestyle. Neolithic period (last
            part of the stone age) is when people started changing from nomadic hunter-gatherers to an
            agriculture-focused society. I wonder how they tracked the sun when moving from place to place, without the
            intricate sundials and standing stones. I can attest - sun still rises in the east, but it must have been
            with a lot less precision that they could predict the seasons changing.</p>
