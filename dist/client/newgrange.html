    Newgrange is something that affected me deeply when I went to see it. There are so many themes packed in here: <br>
    * changing from nomadic people to agriculture-focused society <br>
    * tracking time with extreme precision without mathematics or a representative of reality astronomical model (really
    circling the word "wrong" here).<br>

    I would really like to start exploring these themes in an essay, bullet points, or any other form, really. So far,
    I've mostly spent my time exploring this conversation through casual conversation with people who care to listen and
    engage.

        <p>I am thinking about newgrange again. The room I am staying in is an attic apartment. Bed next to a diagonal
            roof window facing almost directly east. I wake up around 5 each day from the sun (going back promptly to
            sleep of course). Until 10 or so the sun framed by the window travels across the room. I only have a few
            more days, but I think I'll track how it progresses through the room, since I have my own personal.

        <p>Maybe building of the temple was partly a testament to end of the nomadic lifestyle. Neolithic period (last
            part of the stone age) is when people started changing from nomadic hunter-gatherers to an
            agriculture-focused society. I wonder how they tracked the sun when moving from place to place, without the
            intricate sundials and standing stones. I can attest - sun still rises in the east, but it must have been
            with a lot less precision that they could predict the seasons changing.</p>
