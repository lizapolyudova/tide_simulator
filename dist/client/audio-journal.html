        The idea with audio journaling is the same with journaling - explore your feelings in a freeform way; like
        musical improvisation, rather than composition.

    <b>Observation</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1. Get a recording device; ideally, not your phone, but phone is fine too. Just set it to airplane mode
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Go outside. Pick a setting you know well which inspires you or go to a new place.
        </li>
        <li>
            3. Be in that place, allow yourself to steep in the experience. Treat it as a test tube, notice details
        </li>
        <li>
            4a. Describe your surroundings as thought it were a painting.
        </li>
        <li>
            4b. Find a strange looking thing, maybe an optical illusion your mind is playing. Describe what you are seeing and what you believe is creating the illusion.
        </li>
        <li>
            4c. Feel the non-visual things; temperature, smells, humidity, sounds(!). Talk about them in as much detail as possible.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <b>Feelings</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1. Get a recording device
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Wherever you are, press recording and start talking. I find that a familiar setting like a table where I
            eat breakfast or in bed under the covers makes me feel most vulnerable and reminds me of feelings that
            surround me
        </li>
        <li>
            3. Listen to your voice, how it cracks when you hold back the tears or the uncertainty you are facing with
            the long pauses. Acknowledge what feels untrue as it escapes your mouth. Physicality of sound will guide
            you.
        </li>
        <li>
            4. Once you feel released, re-listen to the recording. There's a strange catharsis in hearing yourself in a
            vulnerable state, re-experiencing from outside the voice we reserve for those closest to us.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <b>Summary</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1. Get a recording device; ideally, not your phone, but phone is fine too. Just set it to airplane mode
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Go outside. Pick a setting you know well which inspires you or go to a new place.
        </li>
        <li>
            3. Pick a point in the past and start talking about it. Take tangents as you need to.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            listen back to the recording when you are home
        </li>
        <li>
            do you sound anything like you do in your recorded meetings?
        </li>
        <li>
            are you shy or self-conscious? When do you speed up or slow down? can you close your eyes and imagine where
            you were experiencing the same words?
        </li>
    </ul>
